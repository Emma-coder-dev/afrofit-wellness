    },
    {
      'myth': '❌ Sweating more = more fat burned',
      'truth': '✅ Sweat is just water loss for body cooling. You burn calories through movement and muscle work, not sweating. You can burn lots of calories without sweating much.',
      'category': 'exercise',
    },
    {
      'myth': '❌ Carbs make you fat',
      'truth': '✅ EXCESS calories make you fat, not carbs specifically. Ugali, rice, and chapati are fine in proper portions. It\'s about total calories, not avoiding carbs.',
      'category': 'nutrition',
    },
    {
      'myth': '❌ Women get bulky from lifting weights',
      'truth': '✅ Women have 15-20x less testosterone than men - very hard to get bulky. Strength training builds lean, toned muscles and boosts metabolism.',
      'category': 'exercise',
    },
    {
      'myth': '❌ Eating late at night causes weight gain',
      'truth': '✅ Total daily calories matter, not timing. Eating 1,500 calories at 6pm vs 10pm makes no difference. Focus on what and how much you eat, not when.',
      'category': 'nutrition',
    },
    {
      'myth': '❌ You must exercise daily to lose weight',
      'truth': '✅ Weight loss is 70% diet, 30% exercise. Three 20-minute workouts per week + healthy eating works better than daily exercise with poor diet.',
      'category': 'exercise',
    },
    {
      'myth': '❌ Skipping meals helps you lose weight faster',
      'truth': '✅ Skipping meals slows metabolism and makes you overeat later. Eat regular, balanced meals to keep metabolism active and control hunger.',
      'category': 'nutrition',
    },
    {
      'myth': '❌ Muscle turns into fat when you stop exercising',
      'truth': '✅ Muscle and fat are different tissues. Muscle cannot become fat. When you stop exercising, you lose muscle AND may gain fat if you overeat.',
      'category': 'exercise',
    },
    {
      'myth': '❌ You need expensive gym equipment to get fit',
      'truth': '✅ Bodyweight exercises (push-ups, squats, lunges) are highly effective. Your body is the best equipment. Consistency beats fancy equipment.',
      'category': 'exercise',
    },
    {
      'myth': '❌ Fat-free foods are always healthier',
      'truth': '✅ Fat-free often means more sugar and chemicals. Healthy fats (avocado, groundnuts) are essential. Focus on whole foods, not "fat-free" labels.',

      'myth': '❌ Detox teas/juices cleanse your body',

      'myth': '❌ You can "target" lose weight in one area',

    },
    {
      'myth': '❌ The scale is the best measure of progress',
      'truth': '✅ Muscle weighs more than fat. You can lose fat, gain muscle, and weigh the same. Take measurements, photos, and track how clothes fit.',
      'category': 'progress',
    },
    {
      'myth': '❌ Cardio is better than strength training for weight loss',
      'truth': '✅ Strength training builds muscle, which burns calories even at rest. Combine both: cardio burns calories now, muscle burns calories 24/7.',
      'category': 'exercise',
    },
    {
      'myth': '❌ You must feel sore after every workout',
      'truth': '✅ Soreness just means your muscles aren\'t used to that exercise. No soreness doesn\'t mean no progress. Consistency and progressive challenge matter most.',

      'fact': 'Weight loss happens in the kitchen',

    },
    {
      'fact': 'Sleep affects weight loss',

      'fact': 'Consistency beats intensity',

    {
      'fact': 'Protein helps preserve muscle during weight loss',
